# 🔐 Understanding Vulnerabilities & Why We Manage Them

Welcome! This repo is part of the **Vulnerability Management** series by [Josh Madar](https://www.youtube.com/@joshmadar). In this section, we break down what vulnerabilities really are, why they matter, and how managing them helps protect organizations from financial loss, data breaches, and even loss of life.

## ⚠️ What Is a Vulnerability?

A **vulnerability** is a flaw or weakness in a system that can be exploited. If left unaddressed, it can lead to:

- Data breaches
- Financial loss
- Compromise of critical systems (e.g. power grids, medical devices, electric cars)

## 🧩 Types of Vulnerabilities Covered

### ✅ Software Vulnerabilities
- Outdated third-party applications (e.g. Java, Adobe, Chrome)
- Unpatched operating systems or firmware (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### ⚙️ Configuration Vulnerabilities
- Weak or missing passwords
- Misconfigured settings (e.g. firewalls, access controls)

### 🧍 Human Vulnerabilities
- No hiring screening processes
- Social engineering susceptibility

### 🌍 Environmental Vulnerabilities
- Physical security gaps (e.g. unlocked data centers)
- Location-based risks (e.g. data centers on flood plains)
